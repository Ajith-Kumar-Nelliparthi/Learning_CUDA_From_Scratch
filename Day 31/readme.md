## Day 31 of Learning CUDA:
- Implemented Sum Reduction from naive to most Optimized Kernels.
- During warp shuffle i didn't catch the logic then with the help of bing understood it clearly, now i am willing to write warp shuffle for another problem without any help.
- Implemented Max Reduction from naive to Most optimized kernels. This time i wrote warp reduction without any help.
- Implemented Min Reduction from naive to  most optimized kernels.
