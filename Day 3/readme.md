## Day-3 of Learning CUDA
- Completed subtopics 2.4–2.5 from Chapter 2 of Programming Massively Parallel Processors (PMPP).
- Completed Chapters 1–4 of the CUDA C++ Best Practices Guide.
- Learned about applications of scaling and the two major types of scaling:
	- Weak Scaling
	- Strong Scaling
- Learned the APOD cycle (Assess → Parallelize → Optimize → Deploy) and started identifying these stages inside CUDA code.
- Solved the Vector Addition problem on LeetGPU.
